#Preliminaries

Making this blog into a habit has been a struggle, and I think that makes today's post all the more appropriate. When I journaled on paper, I wrote in third person. It was easier that way. Talking about myself was harder than talking about some generic human being that went through the same things. I'll experiment with that style for a little while.

#Creating Happiness

The boy found it difficult to concentrate. Thinking took more effort than it was worth, so he went out of his way to quiet his mind. He chose to oversleep and live in dreams that seemed to create themselves, rather than invest the effort to create a life in reality. Dreams started feeling so real to the boy, and that made reality that much harder to exist in.

If thinking was hard, doing was harder. Getting out of bed was hard for him that day. Getting into the shower was like summiting Mount Fuji. The boy sat down at what had already become lunch time. Chewing food down seemed like a chore, but swallowing spaghetti whole was unpleasant.

Despite such heavy feelings, the boy continued on. He gulpled his pills down, and soon enough, he felt midly better. At least, better enough to consider doing more than just laying in bed. The boy decided to lounge in a couch and type down some of his feelings for fear that he had held onto them for far too long. Given time, any feeling, good or bad, could fester into a disgusting sludge of emotions.

He felt unmotivated. Unmotivated to play games, to write, to play violin, or the guitar. Yet, paradoxically, he felt bored. The boy wished someone or something came into his life and pulled him out of such a lame situation. Key word was pulled and not yanked, as the latter would have an adverse effect on his mood. The boy was baffled by the contradictory nature of his illness. On one hand, depression kept him stagnant and stuck in a pool of quicksand. On the other hand, moving out of such a situation seemed so dangerous. The boy could even feel the quicksand retaliate whenever he, or someone else, attempted to pull him out of his rut.

Yet, in recognizing this ironic situation, the boy gained insight. If he were to escape from his bondage, he would have to do so slowly. Simply moving to his computer would be a small step towards gaining forward momentum. From there, the boy could watch videos on YouTube of famous musicians, or funny comics. Perhaps he could play Minecraft, or Starcraft, or many of the other games he had to choose from. If anything, his computer would provide an outlet of social interaction as he could speak to any of his friends around the world.

It's such a subtle shift. Asking "Do I want to play video games?" made the boy stagnant. His answer was immediately "no". However, how strange is it that when asked, "Do I want to sit by my computer?" the answer becomes debatable? Sitting nearby his computer may ultimately lead to playing video games, which contradicts the boy's initial reaction.

The boy discovered that he could make happiness by creating opportunities, rather than finding them. Instead of trying to find happiness in gaming, the boy wanted to place himself in a situation that allowed gaming, or anything else on his computer, to make him happy. Afterall, life can either be a menu, or an open book. The boy chose the latter.
