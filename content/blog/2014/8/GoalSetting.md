#Preliminaries

This is my first entry in what I hope to be a series of self-help posts. As I write, I find it ironic, but perhaps appropriate, that my first entry is one on goal setting. I've been yearning writing on this blog for the better half of a month now, and I would say my time planning has become less productive and much more anxiety inducing. I believe it's time that I've finally bit the bullet.

As my website comes to form, I hope to create a style that is both therapeutic for myself as well as for potential readers. I will evaluate my posts and style to innovate the way I write my entries. For the time being, I think I will keep adding a "preliminaries" section to have a meta-discussion of my blog before continuing onto the subject at hand. I imagine preliminaries will become records of my thoughts to peruse at a later time, but they also may provide context for the subject. I will try my best to make preliminaries optional reading, but I hope the reader is still able to find my musings, at the very least, entertaining.

On the topic of goal setting, I will quickly note that I am getting much inspiration for my blog from being in an intensive out-patient treatment program. I will most certainly write about this experience in detail at another time; however, I felt it was prudent to credit the inaugural post of this blog to the therapists and social workers who have led to its creation. Without their healing, I would never have imagined such a creation possible. You have my eternal grattitude.

Well, without further ado, here is goal setting.

#Setting a Goal

##Introduction

The first time I discussed goal setting, I remember the conversation started in a philosophical and ethereal manner. It was enjoyable and interesting, but it took a lot of mental effort. I believe it was effort well spent, so I choose to start with that same method. If the reader deems this discussion is fruitless, then she may choose to skip to the main subject. For others, I appreciate the curiosity.

What is a goal, anyways? How does a goal differentiate itself from an achievement, or fantasy? Is a goal the same thing as a dream? For the time being, don't ponder too long on these questions as we'll get to answer them later. Before that, we have to set up some ground work.

Let us first start with a basic question. What is a "thought"? Academics with doctorate degrees in philosophy may have exceptional insight for this inquiry, but I would like to believe our opinions are no less legitimate than theirs. If time allows, I urge the reader to spend a moment to explore what a thought is. Even a minute will do.

It is my hope that my definition of a thought bares some similarity to the reader's. To accomodate a diverse range of opinions, I will attempt to be as inclusive, but as specific, as possible. But as vague a question as I posed, perhaps it is only reasonable to present a general answer.

For me, a thought is a machination of the brain. Our brains perform immense volumes of chemical reactions to generate the thoughts we think in each moment. Those reactions may occur either by our choosing or by an unconscious engine. For instance, we can focus our minds to synthesize directed thoughts, or stumble across them while day dreaming. Some thoughts, like a lustful crush, can be pervasive, while others are transitory. Thoughts can be racing and can lead to an unending sequence of new thoughts. To our dismay, the brain can also be untimely by being inconveniently sluggish.

I hope my definition has primed the reader's brain to tackle the next question. Now that we have some understanding of a thought, we can ask "what is an idea"? I will respect the reader's sensibility and agree that an idea is, indeed, a thought. In everyday conversation, thoughts and ideas are used interchangeably, so I admit that the question seems trite. However, I would like to entertain the notion that thoughts and ideas are related, but distinguishable from one another. Once more, take a moment to consider what an idea could be, and how it could differ from a thought. Again, even one minute can be exceptionally valuable.

I want to think of an idea as a thought that has some distinct characteristics. Surely, "that's a loaf of bread" and "I can make a sandwich out of that bread" are both thoughts, but I hope the reader agrees that the second phrase separates itself as an idea. The second phrase suggests a train of thoughts or actions, while the first phrase can simply stand on its own.

I would like to think of an idea as an endpoint for a sequence of thoughts. Wanting to make a sandwich begins the synthesis for new thoughts, such as "What kind of meat or cheese do I want?" or "Am I vegetarian, so what kind of hummus would go well with this bread?" There may be a subsequent train of thoughts that instructs the body to spread the condiments, clean and dice the vegetables, stack the ingredients in a desirable order, and to place the sandwich on an appropriately sized dish.

On the other hand, an idea may be a destination for a train of thoughts. For me, a self-help website was an idea, and it spurred many thoughts within me. I had a rather chaotic train of thoughts to lead me to the idea of a website. In no particular order, I thought about what the website would look like, what my posts would talk about, and who I was writing for. Althought unorganized, the idea of creating a website shipped with it an entire set of thoughts.

Now that we have had a rigorous exploration of thoughts and ideas, it may be easier for the reader to define dreams, fantasies, and goals. Although personal exploration may bring novel wisdom, I think our work here is a bit easier than before. I would say that dreams, fantasies, and goals are all ideas (which mean they are also all thoughts), but each have distinguishable characteristics.

These three ideas are different in their feasibility. Dreams _appear_ infeasible. For instance, it is my dream to create a website that is helpful to a great body of people. It feels infeasible for me at this time because the success of my website requires determination and a great deal of luck. A fantasy is an idea that is simply infeasible, such as becoming a unicorn trainer. In the context of my website, it is a fantasy that this website becomes a sizeable source of income so that I may live off my writing.

Finally, we arrive at a goal. A goal is an idea that has been brought into tangible feasibility. It is specific, measurable, achievable, realistic, and timely. Astute readers would have recognized that those characteristics spells the acronym "SMART". Smart goals are the golden standard, and after much mental work, we can now move onto how to construct such goals.

## Setting SMART Goals

Constructing smart goals is a recipe for success. All the letters play off each other, but I'll spend the time to explain what each letter implies and why they are important.

S stands for specific. It means to state your goals in a tangible way. For instance, "I will lose weight" is intangible, while "I will lose five pounds" is specific. Being specific paves the road for goals to be measureable and achievable.

M stands for measurable. The weight example above also works here. By phrasing the goal as "I will lose five pounds", it is possible to have a measurement of success. Without measurable goals, it becomes hard to feel fulfilled from reaching a goal. For me, sobriety is a difficult goal because it is hard for me to measure my success. I currently measure success by counting each day that I have remained sober, but I find it is a poor measurement of success. When considering measurability, be sure to consider what is a good measurement and what is a poor one. Good methods of measurement paves the way for the next letter.

A stands for achievable. Simply put, an achievable goal is one that can be crossed off the bucket list. The goal "I want to be healthy" is a poor example of an achievable goal. Although it is a worthy goal to have, it is a lifelong target and will not be crossed off until death (by which time, health would have long passed us). It may be more effective to have another goal, such as "I will run three times a week." I could cross this goal off my weekly list of goals and have a small feeling of achievment.

R stands for realistic. While achievable and realistic may sound similar, they do have some interesting nuances. This is how one might differentiate a smart goal from a dream or fantasy. It is hard for me to believe that my website will become the next "big thing", and so I have to lower my expectations to the realms of feasibility. Also, my goal to become the most accredited unicorn tamer is also beyond my realistic reach.

T stands for timely. Wanting to lose 50 pounds in a month is specific, measurable, and achievable. However, it is unclear whether the goal is realistic given the time frame. Even if the goal was realistic, it certainly doesn't sound healthy nor sustainable. In all goals, it is important to establish a reasonable timeframe.

It is important to note that one can state smart goals that does not follow all of the criteria. For instance, "I want to become healthy" is an excellent goal to begin with. However, I urge the reader to attempt to go through each letter of the acronym in the hopes to enhancing the initial goal.

Upon completing a goal, it may be worthwhile to evaluate and revise a goal. Perhaps the steps it took to reach the goal had a few kinks to smooth out. Going back to evaluate and revise a goal upgrades a smart goal to a smarter one.

##Implementation

Now that we have an understanding of a smart(er) goal, we may now investigate how to follow through with our aspirations. Certain goals are smaller in scope, such as "I will do the laundry today", whereas goals such as "I want to learn to play the guitar" may take upwards to a decade.

Aside from explaining how the goal is a smart one, it may be helpful to answer some additional questions. The following list are questions that can help the reader define smart goals:

1. How will I know when I have achieved my goal?
2. How will others around me know when I've achieved my goal?
3. What are some barriers that may get in the way of achieving my goal?
4. If there are barriers, what strategies could I use to overcome them?
5. What are the positive outcomes of achieving this goal?
6. What might be the negative outcomes?
7. What are some rewards or affirmations that can help motivate me?

Finally, it may be helpful to plan staggers within a larger goal. If it makes sense to separate by time frame, ask what one could do today to become closer to the goal. Then, possibly using insight from the above list of questions, ask what can be done in a week's time, a month's time, six month's time, a year, and so on and so forth.

It may also be helpful to compartmentalize goals. If there's a large goal, such as renovating a house, it will definitely be helpful to separate the goal by rooms of the house.

In implementation, there are a few affirmations that I believe all readers should remember. Goals are not easy. They require time, but more importantly effort. They require patience and persistence. Smart(er) goals are meant to motivate us. They are designed for us to feel progress and realize our small successes.
